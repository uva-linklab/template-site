Site Template
=============

This is a skeleton template to generate static pages for a website.

[Inspiration](http://democontent.uva1acsf.acsitefactory.com/).

Instructions
------------

Run `generate_html.py` to create a directory called `out` which contains all of
the generated HTML files. You can open `out/index.html` in a browser, and to
host the site copy the `out` directory and the `assets` directory.

```bash
./generate_html.py
```
